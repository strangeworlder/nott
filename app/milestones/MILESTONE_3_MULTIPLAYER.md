## Technical Specifications

### Multiplayer Game Architecture
```typescript
// Multiplayer game session interface
interface MultiplayerGameSession {
  id: string;
  director: Player;
  players: Player[];
  maxPlayers: number;
  status: 'waiting' | 'playing' | 'ended';
  gameState: GameState;
  connections: Map<string, Socket>;
  actionQueue: GameAction[];
}

// Player action interface
interface GameAction {
  id: string;
  playerId: string;
  actionType: 'roll_dice' | 'submit_test' | 'character_action';
  actionData: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  validated: boolean;
}

// Director controls interface
interface DirectorControls {
  canRevealThreatCard: boolean;
  canManageDeck: boolean;
  canControlGamePhase: boolean;
  canApplyVoiceEffects: boolean;
  canNarrate: boolean;
}
```

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Multiplayer game sessions
CREATE TABLE multiplayer_sessions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    director_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'waiting',
    max_players INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
    current_players INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    ended_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Player connections
CREATE TABLE player_connections (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES multiplayer_sessions(id),
    player_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    connected_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    disconnected_at TIMESTAMP,
    connection_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'connected'
);

-- Game actions queue
CREATE TABLE game_action_queue (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES multiplayer_sessions(id),
    player_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    action_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    action_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    validated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Socket.io Multiplayer Events
```typescript
// Connection management
socket.emit('join_game_session', { sessionId: string, playerId: string })
socket.emit('leave_game_session', { sessionId: string, playerId: string })
socket.emit('player_ready', { sessionId: string, playerId: string })

// Game actions
socket.emit('submit_game_action', GameAction)
socket.emit('validate_action', { actionId: string, validated: boolean })
socket.emit('process_action', { actionId: string, result: any })

// Director controls
socket.emit('director_action', { 
  actionType: string, 
  actionData: any 
})

// Real-time updates
socket.on('player_joined', { playerId: string, player: Player })
socket.on('player_left', { playerId: string })
socket.on('game_action_submitted', GameAction)
socket.on('game_action_result', { actionId: string, result: any })
socket.on('director_action_applied', { actionType: string, result: any })
```

## Multiplayer Implementation

### Session Management
```typescript
class MultiplayerSessionManager {
  createSession(directorId: string): MultiplayerGameSession {
    // Create new multiplayer session
  }
  
  joinSession(sessionId: string, playerId: string): boolean {
    // Add player to session
  }
  
  leaveSession(sessionId: string, playerId: string): void {
    // Remove player from session
  }
  
  startGame(sessionId: string): void {
    // Start multiplayer game
  }
}
```

### Action Validation
```typescript
class ActionValidator {
  validateAction(action: GameAction, gameState: GameState): boolean {
    // Validate player can perform action
    // Check game rules and permissions
  }
  
  processAction(action: GameAction): GameActionResult {
    // Process validated action
    // Update game state
    // Broadcast results
  }
}
```

### Real-time Synchronization
```typescript
class RealTimeSync {
  broadcastGameState(sessionId: string, gameState: GameState): void {
    // Broadcast to all connected players
  }
  
  broadcastPlayerAction(sessionId: string, action: GameAction): void {
    // Broadcast player action to all players
  }
  
  handlePlayerDisconnection(playerId: string): void {
    // Handle player disconnection
    // Update game state
    // Notify other players
  }
}
```
