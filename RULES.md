# Night of the Thirteenth

A horror survival tabletop game by Petri Leinonen. Players assume doomed characters trying to see the sunrise while the Director portrays a relentless killer.

---

## Overview

* **Goal:** Players aim to survive until dawn. Most characters won't make it.
* **Tone:** You're the cast of a horror movie. Act accordingly.
* **Survival Odds:** This configuration offers roughly 20–25% chance for each character.

---

## Roles

### The Director

* Plays the killer and narrates the world.
* Sets challenges by revealing Threat Cards and interpreting Tests.
* Builds and manages card decks.

### The Players

* Each plays a distinct character (Archetype) likely doomed.
* Ideal table size: 4 players (minimum 3).
* Players describe actions, ask questions, and resolve Tests.

---

## Components

* **Standard playing card deck** (52 cards) plus **two distinct Jokers** (Red & Black).
* **Dice:** One d10 (Main die) and one d4 (Fallout die) combine to form a "d13."

---

## Setup

1. **Choose a playset** (setting-specific rules may override core rules).
2. **The Director builds decks** (Threat Deck, Reserves, Trophy Pile).
3. **Players create characters** (Name, Archetype, Why, Aptitude).
4. Begin play.

---

## The d13 Dice

* Roll d10 (0–9) + d4 (1–4) = result 1–13.
* Modifiers cannot push individual die results beyond these limits.

---

## Deck Construction

### Threat Deck

1. Shuffle together all 2s, 3s, 4s, and **one** Jack (the first face card).
2. Place this pile face down.
3. Flip the four Aces face up on top.
4. Top card is Threat Card.

> **Revealing:** If the top card is face down, the Director looks at it, flips it face up as the next Threat Card, then reveals the new top card underneath for the next challenge and its Difficulty.

### Reserves

Set aside the remaining cards into five face-down piles:

* **Number Reserve:** All remaining number cards (5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s) not used in the Threat Deck.
* **Face Card Reserves:** Remaining Jacks, Queens, Kings (three separate piles).
* **Jokers:** Red and Black, kept separate for Endgame.

> *Reserves may run dry; this is acceptable.*

### Trophy Pile

* **Start empty** - no initial card is placed.
* The first number card defeated becomes the base difficulty.
* Stack face up; the top card's value is always visible.
* If empty, face cards use difficulty 1 as base.

---

## The Threat Card

The top face-up card of the Threat Deck determines the next challenge.

* **Suit:** Nature of the challenge

  * ♠ Power: Physical
  * ♥ Resolve: Nerve
  * ♣ Intellect: Brains/know‑how
  * ♦ Finesse: Precision

* **Number (1–10):** Severity & Difficulty

  * 1–4: Atmospheric (no Strike risk)
  * 5–7: Potentially dangerous
  * 8–10: Difficult & dangerous

* **Face Cards (J, Q, K):** Confrontations with the Killer

  * **Modifier:** Jack +1, Queen +2, King +3 on top of Trophy Pile value.

---

## Making a Test

When a player attempts a risky action:

1. **Roll d13** (d10 + d4).
2. **Compare** to Threat Card's number (or modified value for face cards).

   * **≥ Difficulty:** Success
   * **< Difficulty:** Failure

### Fallout

The **d4** result (1–4) on the Fallout die indicates severity:

| Roll | Success Fallout                               | Failure Fallout        |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1    | Clean: Perfect; no trace                      | Clean: No extra hassle |
| 2    | Messy: Noise/mess left                        | Messy: Not pretty      |
| 3    | Costly: Lose item/hurt                        | Costly: Personal cost  |
| 4    | Dire: Killer alerted ⇒ +1 Strike if face card | Dire: +1 Strike        |

> **Note:** On a Success against the Killer (face card), Fallout 4 also grants 1 Strike.

---

## Resolving Tests

### Against Number Cards

* **Success:** Move Threat Card → top of Trophy Pile.

  * Add next **one** card from Number Reserve to bottom of Threat Deck.
* **Failure:** Move Threat Card → bottom of Threat Deck.

  * Add next **one** card from Number Reserve under it.
  * If Fallout 4 ⇒ gain 1 Strike.
* Reveal the next Threat Card.

### Facing the Killer (Face Cards)

* **Success:**

  * Draw from Face Card Reserves: Jack (Fallout 1–2) or Queen (Fallout 3–4) → add to Threat Deck.
  * If first time defeating that suit ⇒ remove Threat Card from game (marking a weakness).

    * All four weaknesses ⇒ triggers Endgame.
  * Otherwise, keep Threat Card in Threat Deck.
  * **Shuffle Trophy Pile** after each face card encounter.
* **Failure:**

  * Gain 1 Strike.
  * Add a random King from Face Card Reserves → bottom of Threat Deck.
* Shuffle entire Threat Deck and reveal new Threat Card.

---

## Character Creation

1. **Name** your character.
2. Choose an **Archetype** (e.g. The Jock, The Reporter, The Rebel).
3. Decide **Why** they're here.
4. Select an **Aptitude** (Power, Resolve, Intellect, Finesse).

   * On Tests of matching suit, you may **add/subtract 1** from your Fallout die.

> **Tip:** Assign unique Aptitudes to players for thematic tension.

---

## Resources & Bonuses

### Genre Points

* **Starting amount:** 13 points.
* **Spend 1** to reroll entire d13 and add +1 to the main die (must keep second result).
* Earned by playing into horror tropes.

### Aptitude Bonus

* On Tests matching your Aptitude suit, adjust the Fallout die by ±1.

---

## Strikes & Elimination

* **Strike triggers:**

  * Any Failure vs. Killer.
  * Failure with Fallout 4.
  * Success vs. Killer with Fallout 4.
* Max **3 Strikes** → character dies.
* Each Strike narrates a gruesome near‑miss or fatal flaw.

---

## The Endgame

Once all four face‑suit weaknesses are found:

1. Remove all number cards from Threat Deck, leaving only face cards + both Jokers.
2. Jokers shuffle in.
3. **When a Joker would be drawn**: it isn't shown; its effect triggers immediately.
4. **Shuffle Trophy Pile** when a Joker appears.

### Black Joker (The Twist)

* One last desperate Test (Difficulty = top of Trophy Pile).
* **Success:** remove highest face card from game.
* **Failure:** add a King from Face Card Reserves.
* Black Joker then removed from game.

### Red Joker (The End)

* Final Test (Difficulty = top of Trophy Pile).
* **Success:** survivors see dawn (win).
* **Failure:** character dies; shuffle Red Joker back, continue night.

*Good luck. Most of you won't make it.*
